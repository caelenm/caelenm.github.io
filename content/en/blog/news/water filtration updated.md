Creating a DIY water filtration system using easily available materials like plastic buckets, sand, and charcoal can be a lifesaver in emergency situations. This guide provides detailed instructions for making a water filtration system from scratch, emphasizing its educational purpose and the need for caution in selecting water sources and adhering to boil-water notices.

### Materials

For this DIY water filtration system, youâ€™ll need:

* Two 5-Gallon Plastic Buckets with lids - [Purchase here](https://www.amazon.ca/SeaChoice-Gallon-Plastic-Bucket-90120/dp/B002IZFOGK/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=food+safe+plastic+bucket+5+gallon&amp;sr=8-20&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ecoscotia-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fe9d5ce49a146062285afbe5b9024863&camp=15121&creative=330641)
* Sand (both coarse and fine)
* Activated Charcoal
* Gravel or Pebbles (small, cleaned)
* Cloth (cotton or cheesecloth for layer separation)
* Water source (tap, well, river, etc.)

### Tools

The necessary tools include:

* Tape Measure or Ruler - [Available here](https://www.amazon.ca/CRAFTSMAN-Tape-Measure-Compact-CMHT37443S/dp/B0BVXXLP3T/ref=sr_1_11?crid=5LO4M8OOEVF9&amp;keywords=tape+measure&amp;qid=1704071514&amp;sprefix=tape+measure%252Caps%252C129&amp;sr=8-11&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ecoscotia-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d0445a833208442d3393286b0a9e8803&camp=15121&creative=330641)
* Drill with various Drill Bits - [Find here](https://www.amazon.ca/DEWALT-DCD701-DCD701B-Brushless-Cordless/dp/B07TWK3MX5/ref=sr_1_17?crid=2LDQO4WH6SDIJ&amp;keywords=dewalt+drill&amp;qid=1704071861&amp;sprefix=dewalt+drill%252Caps%252C118&amp;sr=8-17&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ecoscotia-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=0359a4713e256d79cfc026383f6b70cc&camp=15121&creative=330641)

### Instructions

Follow these steps to build your water filtration system:

#### Step 1: Gather Materials and Tools
Ensure you have all materials and tools ready for a smooth and efficient process.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Buckets
1. Clean the buckets with soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly.
2. Check for and repair any damage.
3. Sterilize filtration media (pebbles, sand) using methods like boiling, baking, or UV light exposure.

#### Step 3: Drill Holes in Buckets
1. Secure a bucket upside down on a stable surface.
2. Use a drill with a suitable bit for plastic, applying steady pressure to create holes at the bottom.

#### Step 4: Add Filter Media
Consider water source, contaminants present, and properties of filter media like porosity and flow rate. If the layers are too compacted there will not be enough flow so we want to ensure adequate aeration in the media. 

Layers should be added in this order:
| top of bucket (open) |
|----------------|
| Pebbles |
| Cloth |
| Coarse sand |
|cloth |
| Fine Sand |
|Activated charcoal|
| Cloth |
|Empty receiving container|

### Conclusion and Summary

In summary, building a DIY water filtration system is a practical and educational exercise, particularly valuable in emergency situations. The process involves gathering essential materials and tools, preparing plastic buckets, drilling holes for water passage, and strategically layering filter media like pebbles, sand, and activated charcoal.

This guide has outlined the crucial steps to construct a basic yet effective water filtration system. It highlights the importance of clean water and the empowerment DIY methods offer in ensuring access to it, especially when conventional resources are not available. Remember, this system is intended for emergency or educational use and should not replace standardized water purification methods. Always be cautious with the water source and adhere to safety guidelines.

Creating your own water filtration system is not only a useful skill but also a step towards understanding the complexities of water purification and the importance of sustainable living practices.
