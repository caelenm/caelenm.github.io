Emergencies can strike at any moment, leaving little time for preparation. That's why having a budget emergency kit is crucial for every household. This blog post outlines the necessary and additional items you should include in your kit, explaining the importance of each.

## Necessary Items

1. **Multitool**: A multitool is an essential item in any emergency kit. It combines several tools in one, including knives, pliers, and screwdrivers, making it useful for a variety of tasks from repairing computers to opening cans

2. **Non-perishable Food**: Items like canned soup and granola bars provide nutrition and energy during emergencies. They have a long shelf life, ensuring they're ready when you need them.

3. **Bottled Water**: Water is vital for survival. Bottled water is easy to transport and can be stored for extended periods.

4. **Lighter**: A lighter is essential for starting a fire, whether for warmth or cooking. It's more reliable than matches and can be used in various weather conditions.

5. **First Aid Kit**: Injuries are more likely during emergencies. A first aid kit allows for immediate response to minor injuries, preventing them from becoming severe.

6. **Simple Radio**: A battery-operated or hand-crank radio keeps you informed with news and updates, which is crucial when power and internet are out.

7. **Important Identification**: Keeping copies of important documents like IDs, passports, and insurance papers can be lifesaving in emergencies, especially when evacuation is necessary.

8. **Cash (Small Bills)**: In situations where electronic transactions aren't possible, having cash on hand is essential for purchasing necessary items.

9. **Backup Battery Bank**: Keeps your mobile devices charged when there's no power, ensuring you stay connected with loved ones and emergency services.

10. **Personal Hygiene Items**: Including sanitary products, toothbrush, toothpaste, and wet wipes.

11. **Extra Clothing**: Useful in the case your clothes get wet or dirty

All of these could fit in a backpack for easy transportation if the need arises

## Additional Items

While the above items cover most of the basics, here are a few more suggestions to consider:

-  **Multipurpose Radio**: Upgraded from the simple radio, a multipurpose model might include features like a flashlight, solar charger, usb battery backup, shortwave and weather bands etc.

- **Solar Power Bank**: A solar power bank can charge devices using sunlight, making it useful during prolonged power outages.

- **Lifestraw/Aquatabs**: These water purification tools make it safer to drink from nearly any water source, which is crucial if your bottled water runs out. Lifestraws can filter water from contaminated water while aquatabs disinfect water directly. We recommend if you decide to use these that they be used in conjunction by first disinfecting water with the aquatabs, then using the lifestraw.

- **Emergency Blanket**: Compact and lightweight, an emergency blanket can retain body heat in cold weather and can also be used for signaling. 

- **Folding Saw**: Handy for cutting wood for fires or clearing paths if you need to evacuate.

- **Tarp**: A tarp can be used for shelter, ground cover, for covering broken windows, or as a rain catch.

- **Duct Tape**: Its wide range of uses includes repairing, sealing, and medical applications

- **Encrypted Backup of important files**: This one is slightly more advanced, an SD card with photocopies of a passport, driver's license, passwords, financial info, etc could be a lifesaver if other copies were to become lost or damaged. The only problem being, what happens if it becomes lost (or someone takes it)? We recommend you use a tool such as [Veracrypt](https://veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) for securing your important files. Veracrpyt is free and open source (just like this site!) meaning everyone is can audit and verify the code. Follow the instructions on the website linked above to learn more

- **Whistle**: A whistle can be used to signal for help, especially if you are unable to shout.
- **Gloves**: Protects your hands during tasks like clearing debris or handling hot items.
- **Portable Stove**: Allows for cooking and boiling water when other heat sources are unavailable.
- **Paper Map and Compass**: Useful for navigation if GPS or electronic devices fail.
- **Flashlight and Extra Batteries**: For visibility in power outages; headlamps free up your hands.
- **Insect Repellent and Sunscreen**: Protects against the elements and insect-borne diseases.


By assembling a comprehensive emergency kit, you can ensure your and your family's safety in most unforeseen circumstances. Remember, it's better to be prepared and not need it than to need it and not be prepared.
