# Sustainable Living: Benefits for the Planet and Your Pocket

As university students, making choices that are both economically and environmentally sound is increasingly important. Hereâ€™s a closer look at how adopting certain practices can help you contribute to a greener planet while also being kind to your wallet.

## Public Transport: Antigonish Public Transport

[Antigonish Public Transport](https://antigonishcts.ruralrides.ca/) not only cuts down on individual carbon emissions but also reduces traffic congestion and the need for extensive parking spaces. Public transport uses significantly less fuel per passenger compared to private vehicles, thus reducing greenhouse gases and pollution.

## Farmer's Market: Antigonish Farmer's Market

The [Antigonish Farmer's Market](https://www.antigonishfarmersmarket.ca/) offers locally grown produce, which means the food travels shorter distances to reach you, significantly reducing transportation emissions. Moreover, local markets often promote organic farming, which is better for soil health and biodiversity.

## Bike More or Get an Electric Bike

Cycling or using an electric bike reduces reliance on fossil fuels. These transportation methods emit no pollutants, helping to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They also reduce noise pollution and traffic congestion.

## Install LED Bulbs in Your Light Fixtures

LED bulbs are not only energy-efficient but also have a longer lifespan, which means less waste in landfills. They reduce the demand for electricity, much of which is still generated from fossil fuels, thereby decreasing overall carbon emissions.

## Use a Clothesline Instead of a Dryer

Air-drying clothes saves a significant amount of energy. Dryers are among the most energy-intensive appliances in homes. By using a clothesline, you reduce energy consumption and also the emissions associated with electricity production.

## Cook More at Home

Home cooking means less packaging waste and a smaller carbon footprint, as takeout often involves single-use plastics and additional transportation. Cooking at home allows for more sustainable food choices like local and organic produce.

## Wash Clothes in Cold Water

Approximately 90% of the energy used by washing machines goes into heating water. Cold water washes are effective for most clothing types and can significantly reduce your household's energy consumption and carbon footprint.

## Buy Used Furniture

Purchasing used furniture reduces the demand for new resources and the environmental impact of manufacturing new items. It also helps in cutting down waste, as many discarded furniture pieces are still in good condition.For great deals in Antigonish, check out the local [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/103148913058271).


## Buy Used Electronics

Buying used electronics conserves the limited resources like lithium used in batteries and reduces the environmental impact of manufacturing new devices. Plus, many used electronics are in excellent condition, offering the same functionality at a lower cost.
